colors, ncmpcpp, terminal, 4chan css  from https://github.com/phallus

userChrome.css from http://code.chloechantelle.com

Firefox style only requires userChrome.css, however if you want the vertical and horizontal scrollbars to be hidden, you must include the userChrome subfolder and the javascript contained therein.
